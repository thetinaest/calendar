## Description of Calendar
* This was a challenge for the UW coding bootcamp and contains starter code provided by UW.
* When using this calendar, a user is able to input tasks into certain time slots and save them. If the page is closed or refreshed, these tasks will persist. If the user wants to clear a task or edit a task, they simly click into the hour block and change the text inside. Once they hit save, their new task will remain in that hour block.
* Hour blocks are also color coded. Hours that have passed will be grey. The current hour will be red. And hours that have yet to pass will be green. 

This was created using JQuery, Moment, and bootstrap for design.
